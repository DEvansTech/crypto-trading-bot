# Main program
The main program is TT_v4.py, this program consists of the reinforcement learning and is combined with all the other scripts in this repository.

# BinanceData
This is a simple script used for gathering the data using Binance's API.

# Benchmark_Comparison
This code compares the output of the reinforcement learning agent with common benchmarks. The benchmarks are: buy and hold, RSI divergence, SMA crossover.

After testing the RL agent a graph is plotted, showing the net worth of the agent compared to the benchmarks.
